# VRChat-HP-System
This is just an idea starting as a proof of concept. I want to start either by myself or with help to create a Universal HP system based on avatar Dynamics.
Interactions with Senders and Receivers of the entire body by use of kicks, punches or gun prefabs that have the proper setup will inflict HP damage.
A predetrmined HP bar will be setup with as of right now, no customizability until it is made and improved upon.

**Things to be added**

- Death Animation
- Heal factor
- toggle on or off
- implemntation of a PVP world

**Conclusion**

I wanted to make something i have thought about for a long time. I have friends in RolePlaying communities and other users who are creators.
I want to bring to the board something different and unique.
